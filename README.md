# Jupiter

# Intro

- Jupiter is a personalization based recommendation engine for events, provided an interactive web page for users to search events, update preference and view recommended events.
- The project is on the separation of front-end and backend, the backend  is Java native, includes three servlets, utilized MySQL to store user preference and event information.
- Developed a web service using (Java servlet, REST API) to fetch event data from TicketMaster API.
- Designed a cotent-based recommendation algorithm to recomment events based on the categories of userâ€™s favorite events, and display them from near to far according to the distance from the user.
- Recommendation algorithm will calculates the weight of the categories of event that the user favorites, and preferentially recommend the category of events with high weight.
- Deploy on AWS EC2 [http://3.98.58.39/Jupiter/#](http://3.98.58.39/Jupiter/#)
